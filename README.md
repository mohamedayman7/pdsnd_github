### Project Title
Data Exploration with pandas on Bikeshare Data

###Project Overview
This project focuses on pandas library usage and simple statistics methods to perform a rudimentary analysis on the bikeshare data from three major U.S. cities - Chicago, Washington, and New York City - to display information such as most popular days or most common stations.

### Description
The program takes user input for the city (e.g. Chicago), month for which the user wants to view data (e.g. January; also includes an 'all' option), and day for which the user wants to view data (e.g. Monday; also includes an 'all' option).

Upon receiving the user input, it goes ahead and asks the user if they want to view the raw data (5 rows of data initially) or not. Following the input received, the program prints the following details:

Most popular month
Most popular day
Most popular hour
Most popular start station
Most popular end station
Most popular combination of start and end stations
Total trip duration
Average trip duration
Types of users by number
Types of users by gender (if available)
The oldest user (if available)
The youngest user (if available)
The most common birth year amongst users (if available)



### Files used
- chicago.csv - Stored in the data folder, the chicago.csv file is the dataset containing all bikeshare information for the city of Chicago provided by Udacity.

- new_york_city.csv - Dataset containing all bikeshare information for the city of New York provided by Udacity.

- washington.csv - Dataset containing all bikeshare information for the city of Washington provided by Udacity. 
Note: This does not include the 'Gender' or 'Birth Year' data.

### Built with
Python 3.6.6 - The language used to develop this.
pandas - One of the libraries used for this.
numpy - One of the libraries used for this.
time - One of the libraries used for this.


### Credits
pandas docs - pandas documentation was immensely helpful in understanding the implemention of pandas methods used in this project.
Udacity - Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program and their instructors were extremely helpful while I was pursuing this project.
